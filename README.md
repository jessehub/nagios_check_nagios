This seemingly unlicensed code was found on the internet several years ago and is the best check_raid implementation I've run across. The original author, fixxar did not leave an email address but it can be looked up easily enough. Please reach out to fixxar if you have any questions about attribution, licensing, or distribution. Since there was no license included it must be assumed that fixxar holds ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
